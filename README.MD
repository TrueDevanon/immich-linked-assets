# Immich Linked Assets

A robust SQL-based automation tool for **synchronizing and sharing assets** across multiple [Immich](https://immich.app/) users using a **tag-driven linking system**. It allows seamless cloning of photos, albums, tags, and people metadata directly within the Immich database.

---

### ✅ Tested Immich version: **v2.0.1**

---

## 🚀 Overview

Immich Linked Assets enables collaborative synchronization based on a special `linked` tag. When this tag is applied to an asset, it is automatically **cloned and synchronized** across all connected users.

---

## 🧩 How It Works

The system operates in two main steps:

1. **Database Schema Extension** — Adds new structures to manage linked assets.
2. **Database Triggers** — Automatically handles cloning and syncing in real-time.

### On First Run

* All assets with the `linked` tag are cloned for all participating users.
* The following are included in the cloning process:

  * Asset with metadata
  * Asset tags
  * Albums containing those assets
  * People associated with those assets
  * Data used for context search/face similarity

### After Initial Setup

* **Tag Trigger** — When an asset receives the `linked` tag, it triggers a clone for all linked users.
* **Cloning Logic** — Each user gets a full, independent copy of the asset, including metadata, tags, and facial recognition data.
* **Real-Time Sync** — Any changes by the asset’s owner (metadata, tags, deletions) are instantly propagated to all linked copies.

> ⚠️ **Note:** If you add the `linked` tag *after* running the script, linked assets will still sync, but albums containing them will **not** be cloned.

## ⚙️ Setup Guide

0. **Verify Immich version compatibility.**

1. **Backup Your Database**

   ⚠️ The script modifies your Immich database directly. Back up your data before proceeding. Future Immich updates may affect compatibility.

2. **Create a Linked Album**

   * In Immich, create a new album named `linked album`.
   * In its description, specify the tag name that will act as the `linked` tag.
   * Share this album with users who should participate in synchronization.

3. **(Optional) Set a Display Name**

   * Update your display name in Immich settings. This name is used as part of the automatic tagging system. Each `linked` asset will have:

     1. A shared `linked` tag
     2. A tag with the owner’s name

4. **Prepare Shared Assets**

   * Create the `linked` tag for each participant.
   * Tag all assets you intend to share.
   * Doing this before the first run improves performance significantly.

> 💡 The linked album is only needed for the **initial setup**. After the script completes, it can be safely deleted.

5. **Install the Script**

   Run the following command (update with your database/container details):

   ```bash
   docker exec -i immich_postgres psql --dbname=immich --username=postgres < ./immich_linked_asset.sql
   ```

---

## ❌ Removing the Script

To completely remove linked assets and triggers:

```bash
docker exec -i immich_postgres psql --dbname=immich --username=postgres < ./immich_delete_linked_asset.sql
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** If you only want to remove triggers, comment out or delete all lines except those containing `DROP TRIGGER`.

---

## 🔁 Updating the Script

If Immich updates cause trigger issues, reinstall only the triggers without affecting existing linked assets:

```bash
docker exec -i immich_postgres psql --dbname=immich --username=postgres < ./immich_update_linked_trigger.sql
```

Always check the **tested version** listed at the top before applying updates.

## 🧭 Manual Linked Album Management

After the initial synchronization, new albums are **not** automatically cloned. You can manually link or unlink them using special commands inside the album description.

### 🔗 Create a Linked Album

Add this line to the album description and save:

```
create linked album
```

This will:

* Clone the album for all linked users.
* Clone all assets within it that have the `linked` tag.

### ❌ Remove a Linked Album

To unlink and delete an album from other users’ accounts, add this line to its description:

```
delete linked album
```

This will remove the album for all linked users except the owner.

## 🔄 Synchronization & Permissions

The system follows an **owner/non-owner** model. The owner is the user who originally uploaded the asset.

### Owner Permissions (Changes Are Synced)

* **Edit Metadata** — Synced to all users.
* **Add/Remove Tags** — Synced to all users.
* **Delete Item** — Deleted for everyone.
* **Remove linked Tag** — Asset is unlinked and deleted for all others.

### Non-Owner Permissions (Local Only)

* **Edit Metadata** — Local change; overwritten by owner updates.
* **Add/Remove Tags** — Local change only.
* **Delete Item** — Deletes locally; others are unaffected.

### People/Face & Album Sync Details

* **People Metadata** — Synced when edited by the owner.
* **Linked Faces** — Not automatically synced; re-tag the asset to re-sync.
* **Albums** — Any linked user can add linked assets to any linked album. However, the asset’s owner can remove that asset from any album across accounts, while non-owners can only remove it locally within their own account.

| Edit Asset Metadata      | ✅     | ✅         | ✅ (Owner overwrites)       |   |
| Add/Remove Tags          | ✅     | ✅         | ✅ (Owner overwrites)       |   |
| Modify People            | ✅     | ✅         | ❌ (Requires re-link)       |   |

## 😎 Pro Tips

* To avoid duplicate people entries, merge your **base** to **linked** people across accounts. This ensures new linked assets reuse existing entities. (Note: owner metadata updates will propagate to everyone.)
* Linking assets is not instant — expect ~1–2 seconds per asset on slower disks.
* The Immich *Memories* feature currently does not work correctly with linked assets.
